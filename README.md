# We Love Speed Talks

At [We Love Speed](http://www.welovespeed.com), we manage *call for paper* via a Google Form.
This is nice and handy but totally unreadable.

This tool is a **frontend visualizer** of We Love Speed talk proposals.
For the sake of our sanity.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.</br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Install

Dependencies will be handled via `npm`.

`npm install`

## Developement

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

`npm run deploy`


## Google Spreadsheet
